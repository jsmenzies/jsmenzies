### Hi there üëã

### I'm a Lead Software Engineer Consultant, specialising in architecting and the implementation of real-time event based microservice solutions and API design.

- üß≥ I'm currently working on...
    - ***Eventing Microservices Architecture*** - Leading the Mircoservices team inside of the Financial Crime Platform within a major Australian Bank. My role involved the architecting and overseeing implementation of several complex, cloud based services and supporting APIs. Managing a combination of junior and senior engineers I introduced modern CICD and development practices in addition to upskilling team members in pairing sessions, code reviews and technical deep dives presentations.
    
    - ***Leading POCs*** - Delivered from the ground up a state of the art risk modelling system backed by a graph database in order to analyse threats in real time for fraud detection. My work often includes shareholder demonstrations and presentations to key decision makers securing future expansion work for the customer team I lead. A POC that I solely conceived of and developed was upgraded to a project enabling me to introduce a new technology into the bank - Neo4J. This is now in the bank‚Äôs ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù stage of adoption and has already yielded positive results.
    
    - ***Mentoring*** - Directed a large team of developers, conducting code reviews and ensuring a high standard of code, while producing simple, eÔ¨Écient, reusable code ‚Äì mindful of new technologies, paradigms, and development methodologies. I have led by example in the designing and development of new services and functionality the team has produced. At any one time I am working with the team to develop multiple new services which under my guidance have been successfully and consistently deployed to production. I‚Äôm able to not only identify the key requirements and challenges a new service in development faces, but I‚Äôm able to design elegant, maintainable code and break down complexity into manageable units of work.
